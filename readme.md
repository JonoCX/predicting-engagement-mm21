# Using Interaction Data to Predict Engagement with Interactive Media

The repository contains the notebooks associated with our ACM Multimedia'21 paper. To run the notebooks,
you'll first need to create the necessary virtual environment and install the required libraries (use 
either venv (requirements.txt) or conda (environment.yml))

**This is a semi-active repository, mostly as I'm editing plots for presentations and my PhD thesis. 
To get the version used in the paper, please go to the releases**
